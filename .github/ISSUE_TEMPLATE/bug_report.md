**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Environment:**
 - OS and version: [e.g. CentOS 3]
 - **Megatools version!**

**Self help**
 - If error seems transient (error 509, ERATELIMIT, ...), wait a bit before reporting
 - Run megatools with --debug http,api and check if anything seems out of place (certificate errors for example)
 - Look through [recently closed issues](https://github.com/megous/megatools/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
 - For compilation errors, if you're running an esoteric/old platform/OS, try to fix the error yourself and send the patch.
